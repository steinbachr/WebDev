                I want to play a pickup game now. I want to play right this second but I don't want to
                go to the park only to find no pickup games are happening. Before, this would mean one of two things. 
                Either I could choose the lazy route and continue watching my Breaking Bad marathon. Or, I could risk
                my time and disappointment with the hope that a game will in fact be occurring. This is where InstaPickup
                comes into play.
            </p>
            <p>
                With InstaPickup, finding a game is as easy as signing in with your Facebook id, 
                searching through the list of public games, and rsvping with the provided link. Want to create your own game?
                Yeah, it does that too! Search through your Facebook friends and create the game of your dreams. Or,
                if you hate (most of) your friends, make the game public and allow anyone to join. The world is your
                field with InstaPickup!

                Ok, that's all well and good, but if I really want to find a game or create a game, can't I
                just use Facebook? They have like, groups for pickup games and when I want to create a game I'll just
                make an event and invite all my friends to that. Yes my dear reader, I know this is what you're thinking and,
                if I'm being honest, that is what I used to do as well with not a second thought. However, then I realized
                Facebook didn't make it easy to search for open games that were separate from any discrete group. 
                I wanted to play, I didn't care with whom. I didn't want to have to join a group just to see when that
                group was playing only to be missing out on when various other users not belonging to that group were playing.
            </p>
            <p>
                With InstaPickup, you have a tool dedicated to finding you a pickup game to play in. No public games near
                you? That's fine, create your own and make it private to only the friends you invite or public to anyone.
                InstaFun, InstaActive, InstaPickup.

                If you're like me, sometimes you just have a hankering for a pickup game. But you're
                not always by a computer (if you are, get outside vampire!). For the outdoorsmen among us, we
                created the mobile version of InstaPickup so you can find pickup games whenever, wherever.
