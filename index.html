                        <br />
                        At Rukkus, I've been able to take on a number of challenges including optimizing the API (of which I am most
											  proud, having optimized one particularily slow endpoint by an order of magnitude), building out a v1.0
											  Android application, creating a brand new, SEO-friendly website, and otherwise supporting the biz dev
												team.

                        <br />
                        While working at TheShelf, I was able to both sharpen my Python/Django chops and
												gain invaluable exposure to the business side of working in an early-stage startup. My first task
												upon arrival was to refactor the website entirely. Challenging? Yes. Daunting? Yes. But in the end,
												very positive because I was able to fully understand the code base once finished.
												Subsequent projects included building out a dynamic image collage, re-wiring key parts of the site
												to use Backbone, and optimizing a feed containing millions of items.

                        <br />
                        OpenMile was my first job at a startup, and the reason why I've only worked as startups since!
												Coming in as a co-op (an intern, for all practical purposes), I never felt as though I had any
												less responsibility than the other team members. My daily tasks included responding to bug reports
												filed by the sales team, building out portlets (modular page components), and playing ping-pong. I kid...
												about the ping-pong of course.

                        <br />
                        BackStep is an idea I've been playing with in my head for a month or so and this month decided
                        to start development on. The premise is simple: Have you ever left something in a cab?
                        Hopefully the answer is no, but if it isn't BackStep is for you.
                        Using a combination of methods including widespread aggregation of data and manual effort,
                        BackStep takes on the challenge of finding your items and putting you in contact with the finders
                        of the valuables.

                        <br />
                        The World Cup Challenge was a competition put forth by <a href="http://footballradar.com/">FootballRadar</a>
											  which asked its participants to write a program which would - for each team in the World Cup - print
											  out the probability of that team being knocked out in group, 2nd round, etc. and ending with the probability
											  of that team winning the cup. My solution happened to be the winning one and relied on a number of
											  different factors to choose probabilities including: player skill scores, team chemistry scores,
											  fifa rank, number of "stars" on the team, and past international results.

                        DrinkUp is a venture launched by me and two friends as an effort to make creation and distribution of 
                        drink deals by bars and clubs as simple as logging into a web app and pushing a button. On the user side,
                        an Android and iOS app currently in development gives bar-goers the ability to redeem coupons either as 
                        individuals or as part of a group. It's pretty sweet! Of course I am biased..
